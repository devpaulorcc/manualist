# Manualist is the popular way to create simple documentation
> Manualist is an intuitive and easy-to-use tool. Just create a fork to start documenting your software in a simple way, adding Markdown files to the "public/docs" directory. These files are automatically loaded into a visual interface, allowing fluid navigation between pages. Additionally, you can use HTML to create links from "docs/" and thus the name of the markdown file, having a dynamic route, customize the documentation style and much more.

**Use Manualist** to document your projects in a simple way 🚀

- **Easy customization**: Although the project uses Vue.js, in-depth knowledge is not required to customize its documentation.

- **Dynamic routes**: Routes to your markdown files will be defined from "docs" and then the name of the markdown file, for example "docs/introdution", the file named "introdution.md" will be loaded.

Use Manualist as a base for two documentation, change colors, fonts and other styles.
